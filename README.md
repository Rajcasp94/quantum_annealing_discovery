# quantum_annealing_discovery
This code will help you get started with feature selection using quantum annealing. The target problem is selecting optimal feature subset from 130 features for jane street market prediction in kaggle. Quantum annealing is a heuristic search algorithm that is almost always gurtanteed to return optimal solutions. I have used D-Wave's 2000 qubit quantum annealer. This version of the quantum computer can support upto 64 fully connected variables. However, the probelm here in question needs to be optimized for 130 variables which is more than the supported 64 variables. Hence, to circumvent this problem, I have used an iterative bootstrap feature sampling method. The final set of useful features could be analyzed by observing the number of times a particular features appears in the solution if the sampling is done a sufficient number of time. 
Disclaimer: the code in this project is not optimal because of several restrictions such as limited computing time for the developer's plan at D-Wave. This is enough to get someoone started who is interested in programming the D-Wave's quantum annealer.
